Project Summary

In this project, I reviewed the landscape of apps using a Shopify dataset to figure out what key factors play into the success of a Shopify app. This included three individial parts: 
  
  Part 1 - Counding the number of individual apps in the dataset, line chart with the sum of reviews vs the last modified date, and a scatterplot interpreting the average ratings per review count.

  Part 2 - Using DAX expressions to calculate the average nubmer of helpful reviews and ratings based on if a developer had replied to reviews. 

  Part 3 - Creating bar charts to show the sum of ratings of each developer, the average helpful ratings of each developer, and the most responsive developers for highly reviewed apps (over 500 reviews).
