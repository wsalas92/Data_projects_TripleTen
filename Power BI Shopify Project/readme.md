# Project Summary

In this project, I reviewed the landscape of apps using a Shopify dataset to figure out what key factors play into the success of an app. This included three individual parts: 

## Part 1

Counting the number of individual apps in the dataset, line chart with the sum of reviews vs the last modified date, and a scatterplot interpreting the average ratings per review count.

## Part 2

Using DAX expressions to calculate the average number of helpful reviews and ratings based on whether or not a developer replied to reviews. 

## Part 3

Creating bar charts to show the sum of ratings of each developer, the average helpful ratings of each developer, and the most responsive developers for highly reviewed apps (over 500 reviews).

Screenshots of the project are included in the repo as the full .PIBX file is larger than 100mb - can send upon request.
