# Project Summary

In this project, I performed an analysis using a dataset from a store to gain insights on what was the cause of customer returns and how to reduce the volume of returned orders. The aim of this project was to investigate the nature of the returns, create a dashboard to monitor returns, and a final presentation to the CEO on my analysis. 

### Part 1 

Preliminary review research of the dataset was performed, which included joining the data tables together in Tableau. Charts were created to review the correlation between total sales and total returns, return rate by category, return rate by customer, and other geograpical return rate indicators. 

### Part 2

An interactive dashboard was then created, highlighting the average return rate by product category, by sub-category and state, the total return rate by total sales, and the average return rate by customer ID.

### Part 3

A final presentation was created going through my my analysis of returns. In the presentation I go over the returns per sub-category, identify 10 repeat customers with high returns, and a geographic analysis of the highest concentrations of where returns occur the most. I then go over the dashboard I created and how to use it to monitor returns. 

### Final Recommendations

- Identify what geographic areas are contributing to the two highest returned sub-categories of Binders and Paper
- A Q4 spike in the return rate may indicate high levels of returns around the holiday season
- Investigate further into the top 10 customers returning items - either through a survey or individual contact.
