Project Summary

In this project, I performed an analysis using a dataset from a store to gain insights on what was causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders. By analyzing this data, the aim was to determine what is causing returns, build a dashboard to monitor returns, and create a presentation to showcase my analysis.
