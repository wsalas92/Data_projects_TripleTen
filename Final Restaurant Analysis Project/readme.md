# Final Project

## Project Summary

In this final project, I assumed the role of a junior analyst and was tasked with reviewing the business performance of restaurants in a given Zomato dataset. This project consisted of three different parts: 
  
### Part 1 

Preliminary review research of the dataset and the creation of a decomposition plan. This plan includes the area of focus for the analysis, questions to answer using the dataset, and initial plans for visualizations/data cleanup.

### Part 2

Creation of a dashboard in Tableau Public following the decomposition plan to include relevant charts, interactive dashboards, and a final presentation to review the findings.

### Part 3

Documenting the project in a final report. This final report contained an executive summary, the methodology and documentation of data cleanup, interpretation of the findings, and recommendations for Zomato to improve their business offerings for restaurants included in the dataset.

### Final Recommendations

- Western restaurant brands (like Domino’s, KFC, and Subway) are leading in individual sales amounts (over ₹9M)
- May be of interest to focus on encouraging growth in Chinese cuisine and expanding Western offerings.
- By keeping average costs between ₹265 and ₹339, customers will be most likely torate their purchases over 3.5.
